    FRAME 1V2.DXF      The first metal frame - rectangle with D shape cut from 
                       center.
    FRAME 2V2.DXF      The second metal frame - rectangle with rectangle cut

    FRAME 4V2.DXF      The fourth metal frame - this has not yet been made 
                       or proofed. Four of these will be made to go inside 
                       the perforated metal as fillers. These will be black.
    FRAME V2.DXF       Template for the metal frames. Used as the starting 
                       point for all of the above.
    PERFFORM.DXF       Used to make the wooden form that I bend the perforated 
                       aluminum around. The form is made from 2 identical 
                       pieces of 3/4" MDF glued up to be 1.5".
